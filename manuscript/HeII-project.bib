	abstract = {We calibrated a technique to measure dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies. The technique utilizes the stellar-wind lines in Wolf-Rayet stars, which are widely observed in galaxy spectra. The He II 1640 and 4686 features are recombination lines whose ratio is largely determined by atomic physics. Therefore they can serve as a stellar dust probe in the same way as the Balmer lines are used as a nebular probe. We measured the strength of the He II 1640 line in 97 Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The reddening corrected fluxes follow a tight correlation with a fixed ratio of 7.76 for the He II 1640 to 4686 line ratio. Dust attenuation decreases this ratio. We provide a relation between the stellar E(B-V) and the observed line ratio for several attenuation laws. Combining this technique with the use of the nebular Balmer decrement allows the determination of the stellar and nebular dust attenuation in galaxies and can probe its effects at different stellar age and mass regimes, independently of the initial mass function and the star formation history. We derived the dust reddening from the He II line fluxes and compared it to the reddening from the Balmer decrement and from the slope of the ultraviolet continuum in two star-forming galaxies. The three methods result in dust attenuations which agree to within the errors. Future application of this technique permits studies of the stellar dust attenuation compared to the nebular attenuation in a representative galaxy sample.},

	abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 μm of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at λ{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}40 μm. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\textasciitilde}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\textasciitilde}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\textasciitilde}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 μm and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 μm is {\textasciitilde}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 μm is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

These data were taken with slitless spectroscopy using the G102 and G141 grisms of the Wide-Field-Camera 3 (WFC3) on board the Hubble Space Telescope as part of the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel survey. Interstellar dust extinction is measured from stacked spectra that cover the Balmer decrement (Hα/Hβ). We present dust extinction as a function of Hα luminosity (down to 3 × 1041 erg s-1), galaxy stellar mass (reaching 4 × 108 M ⊙), and rest-frame Hα equivalent width. The faintest galaxies are two times fainter in Hα luminosity than galaxies previously studied at z {\textasciitilde} 1.5. An evolution is observed where galaxies of the same Hα luminosity have lower extinction at higher redshifts, whereas no evolution is found within our error bars with stellar mass. The lower Hα luminosity galaxies in our sample are found to be consistent with no dust extinction. We find an anti-correlation of the [O III] λ5007/Hα flux ratio as a function of luminosity where galaxies with L Hα {\textless} 5 × 1041 erg s-1 are brighter in [O III] λ5007 than Hα. This trend is evident even after extinction correction, suggesting that the increased [O III] λ5007/Hα ratio in low-luminosity galaxies is likely due to lower metallicity and/or higher ionization parameters.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of the dust attenuation of Hα-selected emission-line galaxies at z = 0.8 from the NewHα narrowband survey. The analysis is based on deep follow-up spectroscopy with Magellan/IMACS, which captures the strong rest-frame optical emission lines from [O II] λ3727 to [O III] λ5007. The spectroscopic sample used in this analysis consists of 341 confirmed Hα emitters. We place constraints on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction using diagnostics that can be applied at intermediate redshift. We find that at least 5\% of the objects in our spectroscopic sample can be classified as AGNs and 2\% are composite, i.e., powered by a combination of star formation and AGN activity. We measure the dust attenuation for individual objects from the ratios of the higher order Balmer lines. The Hβ and Hγ pair of lines is detected with S/N {\textgreater} 5 in 55 individual objects and the Hβ and Hδ pair is detected in 50 individual objects. We also create stacked spectra to probe the attenuation in objects without individual detections. The median attenuation at Hα based on the objects with individually detected lines is A(Hα) = 0.9 ± 1.0 mag, in good agreement with the attenuation found in local samples of star-forming galaxies. We find that the z = 0.8 galaxies occupy a similar locus of attenuation as a function of magnitude, mass, and star formation rate (SFR) as a comparison sample drawn from the SDSS DR4. Both the results from the individual z = 0.8 galaxies and from the stacked spectra show consistency with the mass-attenuation and SFR-attenuation relations found in the local universe, indicating that these relations are also applicable at intermediate redshift.},

From optical and ultraviolet (UV) HST images, we find that the star-forming complex as a whole contains at least seven young compact massive clusters. We resolve the two brightest optical knots, A and B, into five individual young massive clusters along our slit, A1-4 and B1, respectively. From UV spectral modelling using the STARBURST99 code of Leitherer et al., and nebular Hβ equivalent widths in the optical, we derive ages that are consistent with the formation of two separate burst events, of {\textasciitilde}4 +/- 1 Myr and {\textless}3 Myr for knots A (A1-4) and B (B1), respectively. A Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) metallicity is measured for both knots from a nebular line analysis, while nebular HeII 4686 is observed in knot B and perhaps in knot A. We detect underlying broad wings on the strongest nebular emission lines indicating velocities up to 600 km s-1. From UV and optical spectroscopy, we estimate that there are {\textasciitilde}95 early WN stars and {\textasciitilde}35 early WC stars in Tol89-A, using empirical template spectra of LMC Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars from Crowther \& Hadfield, with the WC population confined to cluster A2. Remarkably, we also detect a small number of approximately three mid WNs in the smallest (mass) cluster in Tol89-A, A4, whose spectral energy output in the UV is entirely dominated by the WN stars. From the strength of nebular Hβ, we obtain N(O) {\textasciitilde} 690 and 2800 for knots A and B, respectively, which implies N(WR)/N(O) {\textasciitilde} 0.2 for knot A. We also employ a complementary approach using STARBURST99 models, in which the O star content is inferred from the stellar continuum, and the WR population is obtained from spectral synthesis of optical WR features using the grids from Smith et al. We find reasonable agreement between the two methods for the O star content and the N(WR)/N(O) ratio but find that the WR subtype distribution is in error in the STARBURST99 models, with far too few WN stars being predicted. We attribute this failure to the neglect of rotational mixing in evolutionary models. Our various modelling approaches allow us to measure the cluster masses. We identify A1 as a super star cluster (SSC) candidate with a mass of {\textasciitilde}1-2 × 105 Msolar. A total mass of {\textasciitilde}6 × 105 Msolar is inferred for the ionizing sources within Tol89-B.

Our sample consists of 224 star-forming galaxies with zspec = 1.36-2.59 and high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of Hα and Hβ obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We construct composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies in bins of Balmer decrement to measure the attenuation curve. We find a curve that is similar to the SMC extinction curve at λ ≳ 2500 Å. At shorter wavelengths, the shape is identical to that of the Calzetti et al. relation, but with a lower normalization. Hence, the new attenuation curve results in star formation rates (SFRs) that are ≈ 20\% lower, and stellar masses that are \{Δ \}\{log\}(\{M\}*\{/M\}⊙ )≃ 0.16 dex lower, than those obtained with the Calzetti relation. We find that the difference in the total attenuation of the ionized gas and stellar continuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs ≳ 20 M⊙ yr-1, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function, the nebular emission lines suffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. A simple model that can account for these trends is one in which the UV through optical stellar continuum is dominated by a population of less-reddened stars, while the nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated by dustier stellar populations for galaxies with large SFRs, as a result of the increased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. Consequently, UV- and SED-based SFRs may underestimate the total SFR at even modest levels of ≈20 M⊙ yr-1. Based on data obtained at the W.M.

The goals of this work are threefold. First, we quantify the W-R and O-star content for selected massive young star clusters. These results are compared with similar estimates made from optical spectroscopy available in the literature. We conclude that the He II λ4686 equivalent width is a poor diagnostic measure of the true W-R content. Second, we present the strongest known He II λ1640 emission feature in a local starburst galaxy. This feature is clearly of stellar origin in the massive cluster NGC 3125-1, as it is broadened ({\textasciitilde}1000 km s-1). Strong N IV λ1488 and N V λ1720 emission lines commonly found in the spectra of individual W-R stars of WN subtype are also observed in the spectrum of NGC 3125-1. Finally, we create empirical spectral templates to gain a basic understanding of the recently observed strong He II λ1640 feature seen in Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at redshifts z{\textasciitilde}3. The UV field observed in local starbursts provides a good overall match to the continuum and weak photospheric features in LBGs in the spectral range λλ1300-1700 but cannot reproduce the He II λ1640 emission seen in the composite LBG sample of Shapley et al. An additional (ad hoc) 10\%-15\% contribution from ``extreme'' W-R clusters similar to NGC 3125-1 on top of the field provides a good match to the strength of this feature.

	abstract = {The emission lines in Wolf-Rayet stars may be utilized to determine the absorption properties of their line-of-sight interstellar medium. One can measure the line strengths both in terms of the equivalent widths (in units of the continuum) and fluxes. In general, in a comparison of two lines, the equivalent width ratio is extinction independent; its value depends on intrinsic properties of the objects in question. The line flux ratio will differ by a constant factor and the absorption properties of the interstellar medium. As an example of this method, we compare the measurements of the He II emission features at λ 4686 and λ 1640 in a number of WN stars in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We show that their equivalent width ratios are single valued and are independent of the spectral subtypes. We adopt an LMC extinction law and then utilize the line fluxes in the LMC WN stars to evaluate the expected line flux ratio in this purely empirical approach. We derive the reddening for the stars in the Galaxy using a galactic extinction law and their observed line flux ratios. There is very good agreement of our derived reddening with previous determinations. It is possible to generalize this method by using measurements of several lines in W-R stars at various wavelengths. One could then derive the extinction law itself in front of both WN and WC subtypes. This may have eventual application to determinations of the absorption properties of the interstellar medium in more distant galaxies.},

	abstract = {We investigate the nature of the diffuse intracluster ultraviolet light seen in 12 local starburst galaxies, using long-slit ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We take this faint intracluster light to be the field in each galaxy and compare its spectroscopic signature with Starburst99 evolutionary synthesis models and with neighboring star clusters. Our main result is that the diffuse ultraviolet light in 11 of the 12 starbursts lacks the strong O star wind features that are clearly visible in spectra of luminous clusters in the same galaxies. The difference in stellar features dominating cluster and field spectra indicates that the field light comes primarily from a different stellar population and not from scattering of UV photons originating in the massive clusters. A cut along the spatial direction of the UV spectra establishes that the field light is not smooth but rather shows numerous ``bumps and wiggles.'' Roughly 30\%-60\% of these faint peaks seen in field regions of the closest ({\textless}4 Mpc) starbursts appear to be resolved, suggesting a contribution from superpositions of stars and/or faint star clusters. Complementary WFPC2 UVI imaging for the three nearest target galaxies, NGC 4214, NGC 4449, and NGC 5253, is used to obtain a broader picture and establish that all three galaxies have a dispersed population of unresolved, luminous blue sources. Because the field spectra are dominated by B stars, we suggest that the individual sources observed in the WFPC2 images are individual B stars (rather than O stars) or small star clusters. We consider several scenarios to understand the lack of observed massive stars in the field and their implications for the origin of the field stellar population. If the field stellar populations formed in situ, the field must have either an IMF that is steeper than Salpeter (α{\textasciitilde}-3.0 to -3.5) or a Salpeter slope with an upper mass cutoff of 30-50 Msolar. If star formation occurs primarily in star clusters, the field could be composed of older, faded clusters and/or a population that is coeval with the luminous clusters but lower in mass. We use these benchmark populations to place constraints on the field stellar population origin. Although the field probably includes stars of different ages, the UV light is dominated by the youngest stellar populations in the field. If the field is composed of older, dissolving clusters, we estimate that star clusters (regardless of mass) need to dissolve on timescales 7-10 Myr to create the field. If the field is composed of young clusters that fall below the detection limit of individual sources in our spectroscopy, they would have to be several hundred solar masses or less, in order to be deficient in O stars, despite their extreme youth.

	abstract = {The objective of this work is twofold. First, we seek evidence for or against the depletion of massive stars in metal-rich starbursts. A second, equally important goal is to perform a consistency test of the latest generation of starburst models in such a high-metallicity environment. We have obtained high spatial resolution ultraviolet and optical STIS spectroscopy and imaging of the metal-rich nuclear starburst in NGC 3049. The stellar continuum and the absorption-line spectrum in the ultraviolet are used to constrain the massive stellar population. The strong, blueshifted stellar lines of C IV and Si IV detected in the UV spectra indicate a metal-rich, compact, massive ({\textasciitilde}106 Msolar) cluster of age 3-4 Myr emitting the UV-optical continuum. We find strong evidence against a depletion of massive stars in this metal-rich cluster. The derived age and the upper mass-limit cutoff of the initial mass function are also consistent with the detection of Wolf-Rayet (W-R) features at optical wavelengths. As a second, independent constraint on the massive stellar content, the nebular emission-line spectrum is modeled with photoionization codes using stellar spectra from evolutionary synthesis models. The morphology of the nuclear starburst of NGC 3049 from the STIS images indicates a simple geometry for the nebular emission-line region. However, the nebular lines are badly reproduced by 3-4 Myr instantaneous bursts, as required by the UV line spectrum, when unblanketed W-R and/or Kurucz stellar atmospheres are used. The corresponding number of photons above 24 and 54 eV in the synthetic models is too high in comparison with values suggested by the observed line ratios. Since the ionizing spectrum in this regime is dominated by emission from W-R stars, this discrepancy between observations and models is most likely the result of incorrect assumptions about the W-R stars. Thus, we conclude that the nebular spectrum of high-metallicity starbursts is poorly reproduced by models for W-R-dominated populations. However, the new model set of Smith et al. with blanketed W-R and O atmospheres and adjusted W-R temperatures predicts a softer far-UV radiation field, providing a better match to the data.},

	abstract = {We analyze the IUE UV and the optical spectra of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies in order to study the average properties of dust extinction in extended regions of galaxies. The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines Hα and Hβ is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting region. The extinction law of UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.},

              Far-ultraviolet (FUV; ∼1200–2000 Å) spectra are fundamental to our understanding of star-forming galaxies, providing a unique window on massive stellar populations, chemical evolution, feedback processes, and reionization. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope will soon usher in a new era, pushing the UV spectroscopic frontier to higher redshifts than ever before; however, its success hinges on a comprehensive understanding of the massive star populations and gas conditions that power the observed UV spectral features. This requires a level of detail that is only possible with a combination of ample wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise, spectral-resolution, and sample diversity that has not yet been achieved by any FUV spectral database. We present the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph Legacy Spectroscopic Survey (CLASSY) treasury and its first high-level science product, the CLASSY atlas. CLASSY builds on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive to construct the first high-quality (S/N

We use a new method of constraining SED fits with infrared luminosity (SED+LIR fitting), and parameterized attenuation curves determined with the CIGALE SED-fitting code. Attenuation curve slopes and UV bump strengths are reasonably well constrained independently from one another. We find that \{A\}λ /\{A\}V attenuation curves exhibit a very wide range of slopes that are on average as steep as the curve slope of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The slope is a strong function of optical opacity. Opaque galaxies have shallower curves—in agreement with recent radiative transfer models. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence on stellar mass: more massive galaxies have shallower slopes. Attenuation curves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none to Milky Way (MW)-like, with an average strength one-third that of the MW bump. Notably, local analogs of high-redshift galaxies have an average curve that is somewhat steeper than the SMC curve, with a modest UV bump that can be, to first order, ignored, as its effect on the near-UV magnitude is 0.1 mag. Neither the slopes nor the strengths of the UV bump depend on gas-phase metallicity. Functional forms for attenuation laws are presented for normal star-forming galaxies, high-z analogs, and quiescent galaxies. We release the catalog of associated star formation rates and stellar masses (GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog 2).},

	abstract = {Grids of models of massive stars (M ≥ 20 M⊙) with rotation are computed for metallicities Z ranging from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to that of the Galactic Centre. The hydrostatic effects of rotation, the rotational mixing and the enhancements of the mass loss rates by rotation are included. The evolution of the surface rotational velocities of the most massive O-stars mainly depends on the mass loss rates and thus on the initial Z value. The minimum initial mass for a star for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase is lowered by rotation. For all metallicities, rotating stars enter the WR phase at an earlier stage of evolution and the WR lifetimes are increased, mainly as a result of the increased duration of the eWNL phase. Models of WR stars predict in general rather low rotation velocities ({\textless}50 km s-1) with a few possible exceptions, particularly at metallicities lower than solar where WR star models have in general faster rotation and more chance to reach the break-up limit. The properties of the WR populations as predicted by the rotating models are in general in much better agreement with the observations in nearby galaxies. Some possible remaining difficulties in these comparisons are mentioned. The evolution of the chemical abundances is largely influenced by rotation in all phases from the MS phase to the WN and WC phases. We also show that the interval of initial masses going through the LBV stage is changing with Z and Ω. The observed variation with metallicity of the fractions of type Ib/Ic supernovae with respect to type II supernovae as found by Prantzos \& Boissier ({\textbackslash}cite\{Pr03\}) is very well reproduced by the rotating models, while non-rotating models predict much too low ratios. This indicates that the minimum initial masses of single stars going through a WR phase are consistently predicted. At Z = 0.040, stars with initial masses above 50 M⊙ reach a final mass at the time of supernova explosion between 5 and 7.5 M⊙, while at Z = 0.004, like in the SMC, the final masses of stars are in the range of 17-29 M⊙. On the whole, rotation appears to be an essential parameter even for the WR properties. Detailed tables describing the evolutionary tracks are available on the web.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high signal-to-noise composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, H II regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Lyα equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra that are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyα emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Lyα and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Additionally, galaxies with rest-frame WLyα{\textgreater}=20 Å in emission have weaker than average high-ionization lines and nebular emission lines that are significantly stronger than in the sample as a whole. Most of the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing neutral gas, which contains dust and the range of velocities over which this gas is absorbing. In contrast, the strengths of collisionally excited nebular emission lines should not be affected by the nature of the outflow, and variations in these lines may indicate differences in the temperatures and metallicities in H II regions of galaxies with very strong Lyα emission. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs and its relationship to the escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}3.

	abstract = {We report the results of a systematic study of the vacuum ultraviolet (λ {\textasciitilde}= 1150-2000 Å) spectra of a sample of 45 starburst and related galaxies observed with the IUE satellite. These span broad ranges in metallicity (from 0.02 to 3 times solar), bolometric luminosity ({\textasciitilde}107-4 × 1011 L⊙), and galaxy properties (e.g., including low-mass dwarf galaxies, normal disk galaxies, and massive galactic mergers). The projected size of the IUE spectroscopic aperture is typically 1 to several kpc and therefore usually encompasses the entire starburst and is similar to the aperture sizes used for spectroscopy of high-redshift galaxies. Our principal conclusion is that local starbursts occupy a very small fractional volume in the multidimensional manifold defined by such fundamental parameters as the extinction, metallicity, and vacuum-UV line strengths (both stellar and interstellar) of the starburst and the rotation speed (mass) and absolute magnitude of the starburst's ``host'' galaxy. More metal-rich starbursts are redder and more heavily extinguished in the UV, are more luminous, have stronger vacuum-UV lines, and occur in more massive and optically brighter host galaxies. We advocate using these local starbursts as a ``training set'' to learn how to interpret the rest frame UV spectra of star-forming galaxies at high redshift better, and we stress that the degree of similarity between local starbursts and high-redshift galaxies in this multidimensional parameter space can already be tested empirically. The results on local starbursts suggest that the high- redshift ``Lyman Dropout'' galaxies are typically highly reddened and extinguished by dust (by an average factor of 5-10 in the UV), may have moderately high metallicities (0.1-1 times solar?), are probably building galaxies with stellar surface-mass densities similar to present-day ellipticals, and may be suffering substantial losses of metal-enriched gas that can ``pollute'' the intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {We present a combined analysis of rest-frame far-UV (FUV; 1000-2000 Å) and rest-frame optical (3600-7000 Å) composite spectra formed from very deep Keck/LRIS and Keck/MOSFIRE observations of a sample of 30 star-forming galaxies with z=2.40+/- 0.11, selected to be broadly representative of the full KBSS-MOSFIRE spectroscopic survey. Since the same massive stars are responsible for the observed FUV continuum and for the excitation of the observed nebular emission, a self-consistent stellar population synthesis model should simultaneously match the details of the FUV stellar+nebular continuum and—when inserted as the excitation source in photoionization models—predict all observed nebular emission line ratios. We find that only models including massive star binaries, having low stellar metallicity (\{Z\}* /\{Z\}⊙ ≃ 0.1) but relatively high nebular (ionized gas-phase) abundances (\{Z\}\{\{neb\}\}/\{Z\}⊙ ≃ 0.5), can successfully match all of the observational constraints. We show that this apparent discrepancy is naturally explained by highly super-solar O/Fe (≃ 4\{--\}5 \{(\{\{O\}\}/\{Fe\})\}⊙ ), expected for a gas whose enrichment is dominated by the products of core-collapse supernovae. While O dominates the physics of the ionized gas (and thus the nebular emission lines), Fe dominates the extreme-UV (EUV) and FUV opacity and controls the mass-loss rate from massive stars, resulting in particularly dramatic effects for massive stars in binary systems. This high nebular excitation—caused by the hard EUV spectra of Fe-poor massive stars—is much more common at high redshift (z≳ 2) than low redshift due to systematic differences in the star formation history of typical galaxies.

	abstract = {The fraction of ionizing photons that escape from young star-forming galaxies is one of the largest uncertainties in determining the role of galaxies in cosmic reionization. Yet traditional techniques for measuring this fraction are inapplicable at the redshifts of interest due to foreground screening by the Lyα forest. In an earlier study, we demonstrated a reduction in the equivalent width of low-ionization absorption lines in composite spectra of Lyman break galaxies at z {\textasciitilde}= 4 compared to similar measures at z {\textasciitilde}= 3. This might imply a lower covering fraction of neutral gas and hence an increase with redshift in the escape fraction of ionizing photons. However, our spectral resolution was inadequate to differentiate between several alternative explanations, including changes with redshift in the outflow kinematics. Here we present higher quality spectra of three gravitationally lensed Lyman break galaxies at z {\textasciitilde}= 4 with a spectral resolution sufficient to break this degeneracy of interpretation. We present a method for deriving the covering fraction of low-ionization gas as a function of outflow velocity and compare the results with similar quality data taken for galaxies at lower redshift. We find an interesting but tentative trend of lower covering fractions of low-ionization gas for galaxies with strong Lyα emission. In combination with the demographic trends of Lyα emission with redshift from our earlier work, our results provide new evidence for a reduction in the average H I covering fraction, and hence an increase in the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from Lyman break galaxies, with redshift.},

	abstract = {We report the identification of very massive stars (VMS; mass {\textgreater} 100 M⊙) that may be segregated in the center of the young massive star cluster at z = 2.37 hosted in the lensed galaxy called Sunburst galaxy. This result is based on two pieces of evidence: (1) VLT/MUSE spectra of several multiple images of the same star cluster show key spectral signatures of VMS, such as the He IIλ1640 broad emission, N IVλ1486 emission, and an N IVλ1720 P Cygni profile. In particular, He IIλ1640 is broad (∼1610 ± 300 km s−1), with an equivalent width of 3 Å, and asymmetric profile. These features require an extremely young (∼2.5 Myr) stellar population component in which the masses of the stars exceed 100 M⊙. When a Salpeter initial mass function and BPASS models for normal massive stars are assumed, the observed spectral features require ∼400 VMS. (2) The same star cluster is detected at a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼100 in the Lyman continuum domain (λ {\textless} 900 Å). The Lyman continuum emission emerges from a region with a radius that is at least twice smaller than what is observed at 1700 Å (independently of magnification) and is located in the center of the cluster. After delensing, the effective radii in absolute scales are Reff[LyC] ∼ 4.7 ± 1.5 pc and Reff[1700] = 7.8 ± 1.4 pc. The Lyman continuum radiation is mainly produced by hot and massive stars, which implies that their spatial distribution (including that of VMS) is preferentially more confined in the central parts of the cluster. Approximately 400 VMS hosted by a cluster of ∼107 M⊙ produce ∼15\% of the escaping Lyman continuum photons, and the remaining photons are produced by other massive early-type stars.

The catalog contains 6617 objects with high-quality spectra (two or more spectral features), and 1798 objects with a single spectroscopic feature confirmed by the photometric redshift. For 2024 typically faint objects, we could not obtain reliable redshifts. The objects have been selected from a variety of input catalogs based on multi-wavelength observations in the field, and thus have a diverse selection function, which enables the study of the diversity in the galaxy population. The magnitude distribution of our objects is peaked at I AB ∼ 23 and K AB ∼ 21, with a secondary peak at K AB ∼ 24. We sample a broad redshift distribution in the range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 6, with one peak at z ∼ 1, and another one around z ∼ 4. We have identified 13 redshift spikes at z {\textgreater} 0.65 with chance probabilities {\textless} 4 × 10-4, some of which are clearly related to protocluster structures of sizes {\textgreater}10 Mpc. An object-to-object comparison with a multitude of other spectroscopic samples in the same field shows that our DEIMOS sample is among the best in terms of fraction of spectroscopic failures and relative redshift accuracy. We have determined the fraction of spectroscopic blends to about 0.8\% in our sample. This is likely a lower limit and at any rate well below the most pessimistic expectations.

We find galaxies with weak or no Lyα emission to have metallicities comparable to z ∼ 2 galaxies and therefore may represent an evolved subpopulation of z∼ 5 galaxies. We find a correlation between metallicity and dust in good agreement with local galaxies and an inverse trend between metallicity and star-formation rate consistent with observations at z ∼ 2. The relation between stellar mass and metallicity (MZ relation) is similar to z∼ 3.5, but there are indications of it being slightly shallower, in particular for the young, Lyα-emitting galaxies. We show that, within a “bathtub” approach, a shallower MZ relation is expected in the case of a fast (exponential) build-up of stellar mass with an e-folding time of 100-200 Myr. Because of this fast evolution, the process of dust production and metal enrichment as a function of mass could be more stochastic in the first billion years of galaxy formation compared to later times.},

The prime high-level science product of CLASSY is accurately coadded UV spectra, ranging from {\textasciitilde}1000 to 2000 Å, derived from a combination of archival and new data obtained with HST's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). This paper details the multistage technical processes of creating this prime data product and the methodologies involved in extracting, reducing, aligning, and coadding far-ultraviolet and near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectra. We provide guidelines on how to successfully utilize COS observations of extended sources, despite COS being optimized for point sources, and best-practice recommendations for the coaddition of UV spectra in general. Moreover, we discuss the effects of our reduction and coaddition techniques in the scientific application of the CLASSY data. In particular, we find that accurately accounting for flux calibration offsets can affect the derived properties of the stellar populations, while customized extractions of NUV spectra for extended sources are essential for correctly diagnosing the metallicity of galaxies via C III] nebular emission. Despite changes in spectral resolution of up to {\textasciitilde}25\% between individual data sets (due to changes in the COS line-spread function), no adverse affects were observed on the difference in velocity width and outflow velocities of isolated absorption lines when measured in the final combined data products, owing in part to our signal-to-noise regime of S/N {\textless} 20. * Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

Methods: The CO (J = 2-1) IRAM all-disk survey was used to identify and classify 566 GMCs with masses between 2 × 104 and 2 × 106M⊙ across the whole star-forming disk of M 33. In the same area, there are 630 YSCCs that we identified using Spitzer-24 μm data. Some YSCCs are embedded star-forming sites, while the majority have GALEX-UV and Hα counterparts with estimated cluster masses and ages. Results: The GMC classes correspond to different cloud evolutionary stages: inactive clouds are 32\% of the total and classified clouds with embedded and exposed star formation are 16\% and 52\% of the total, respectively. Across the regular southern spiral arm, inactive clouds are preferentially located in the inner part of the arm, possibly suggesting a triggering of star formation as the cloud crosses the arm. The spatial correlation between YSCCs and GMCs is extremely strong, with a typical separation of 17 pc. This is less than half the CO (2-1) beam size and illustrates the remarkable physical link between the two populations. GMCs and YSCCs follow the HI filaments, except in the outermost regions, where the survey finds fewer GMCs than YSCCs, which is most likely due to undetected clouds with low CO luminosity. The distribution of the non-embedded YSCC ages peaks around 5 Myr, with only a few being as old as 8-10 Myr. These age estimates together with the number of GMCs in the various evolutionary stages lead us to conclude that 14 Myr is the typical lifetime of a GMC in M 33 prior to cloud dispersal. The inactive and embedded phases are short, lasting about 4 and 2 Myr, respectively. This underlines that embedded YSCCs rapidly break out from the clouds and become partially visible in Hα or UV long before cloud dispersal.

	abstract = {Using recently acquired Hubble Space Telescope NIR observations (J, Paβ, and H bands) of the nearby galaxy NGC 1313, we investigate the timescales required by a young star cluster to emerge from its natal cloud. We search for extincted star clusters, potentially embedded in their natal cloud as either (1) compact sources in regions with high Hα/Paβ extinctions or (2) compact H II regions that appear as point-like sources in the Paβ emission map. The NUV-optical-NIR photometry of the candidate clusters is used to derive their ages, masses, and extinctions via a least-χ2 spectral energy distribution broad- and narrowband fitting process. The 100 clusters in the final samples have masses in the range \$\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\}\_\{10\}(M/\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \})=2.5{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}3.5\$ and moderate extinctions, E(B - V) ≲ 1.0 mag. Focusing on the young clusters (0-6 Myr), we derive a weak correlation between extinction and age of the clusters. Almost half of the clusters have low extinctions, E(B - V) {\textless} 0.25 mag, already at very young ages (≤3 Myr), suggesting that dust is quickly removed from clusters. A stronger correlation is found between the morphology of the nebular emission (compact, partial or absent, both in Hα and Paβ) and cluster age. Relative fractions of clusters associated with a specific nebular morphology are used to estimate the typical timescales for clearing the natal gas cloud, resulting in between 3 and 5 Myr, ∼1 Myr older than what was estimated from NUV-optical-based cluster studies. This difference hints at a bias for optical-only-based studies, which James Webb Space Telescope will address in the coming years.},

	abstract = {We present an investigation of the relationship between giant molecular cloud (GMC) properties and the associated stellar clusters in the nearby flocculent galaxy NGC 7793. We combine the star cluster catalogue from the HST LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey) programme with the 15 pc resolution ALMA CO(2-1) observations. We find a strong spatial correlation between young star clusters and GMCs such that all clusters still associated with a GMC are younger than 11 Myr and display a median age of 2 Myr. The age distribution increases gradually as the cluster-GMC distance increases, with star clusters that are spatially unassociated with molecular gas exhibiting a median age of 7 Myr. Thus, star clusters are able to emerge from their natal clouds long before the time-scale required for clouds to disperse. To investigate if the hierarchy observed in the stellar components is inherited from the GMCs, we quantify the amount of clustering in the spatial distributions of the components and find that the star clusters have a fractal dimension slope of -0.35 ± 0.03, significantly more clustered than the molecular cloud hierarchy with slope of -0.18 ± 0.04 over the range 40-800 pc. We find, however, that the spatial clustering becomes comparable in strength for GMCs and star clusters with slopes of -0.44 ± 0.03 and -0.45 ± 0.06, respectively, when we compare massive ({\textgreater}105 M⊙) GMCs to massive and young star clusters. This shows that massive star clusters trace the same hierarchy as their parent GMCs, under the assumption that the star formation efficiency is a few per cent.},

	abstract = {Feedback from massive stars plays a key role in molecular cloud evolution. After the onset of star formation, the young stellar population is exposed by photoionization, winds, supernovae, and radiation pressure from massive stars. Recent observations of nearby galaxies have provided the evolutionary timeline between molecular clouds and exposed young stars, but the duration of the embedded phase of massive star formation is still ill-constrained. We measure how long massive stellar populations remain embedded within their natal cloud, by applying a statistical method to six nearby galaxies at \$20\{-\}100{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mbox\{\$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textasciitilde}pc\}\$\}\$ resolution, using CO, Spitzer 24\${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu m\$, and H α emission as tracers of molecular clouds, embedded star formation, and exposed star formation, respectively. We find that the embedded phase (with CO and 24\${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu m\$ emission) lasts for 2-7 Myr and constitutes \$17\{-\}47\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the cloud lifetime. During approximately the first half of this phase, the region is invisible in H α, making it heavily obscured. For the second half of this phase, the region also emits in H α and is partially exposed. Once the cloud has been dispersed by feedback, 24\${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mu m\$ emission no longer traces ongoing star formation, but remains detectable for another 2-9 Myr through the emission from ambient CO-dark gas, tracing star formation that recently ended. The short duration of massive star formation suggests that pre-supernova feedback (photoionization and winds) is important in disrupting molecular clouds. The measured time-scales do not show significant correlations with environmental properties (e.g. metallicity). Future JWST observations will enable these measurements routinely across the nearby galaxy population.},

Here we leverage the extraordinary new high-resolution infrared imaging from JWST to begin the study of dust-embedded star clusters in nearby galaxies throughout the Local Volume. We present a technique for identifying dust-embedded clusters in NGC 7496 (18.7 Mpc), the first galaxy to be observed by the PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1 Treasury Survey. We select sources that have strong 3.3 μm PAH emission based on a F300M - F335M color excess and identify 67 candidate embedded clusters. Only eight of these are found in the PHANGS-HST optically selected cluster catalog, and all are young (six have SED fit ages of {\textasciitilde}1 Myr). We find that this sample of embedded cluster candidates may significantly increase the census of young clusters in NGC 7496 from the PHANGS-HST catalog; the number of clusters younger than {\textasciitilde}2 Myr could be increased by a factor of 2. Candidates are preferentially located in dust lanes and are coincident with the peaks in the PHANGS-ALMA CO (2-1) maps. We take a first look at concentration indices, luminosity functions, SEDs spanning from 2700 Å to 21 μm, and stellar masses (estimated to be between {\textasciitilde}104 and 105 M ⊙). The methods tested here provide a basis for future work to derive accurate constraints on the physical properties of embedded clusters, characterize the completeness of cluster samples, and expand analysis to all 19 galaxies in the PHANGS-JWST sample, which will enable basic unsolved problems in star formation and cluster evolution to be addressed.},

The star cluster catalogues are from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) and the molecular clouds from the Plateau de Bure Interefrometer Arcsecond Whirpool Survey (PAWS). We find that younger star clusters are spatially closer to molecular clouds than older star clusters. The median age for clusters associated with clouds is 4 Myr, whereas it is 50 Myr for clusters that are sufficiently separated from a molecular cloud to be considered unassociated. After ∼6 Myr, the majority of the star clusters lose association with their molecular gas. Younger star clusters are also preferentially located in stellar spiral arms where they are hierarchically distributed in kpc-size regions for 50-100 Myr before dispersing. The youngest star clusters are more strongly clustered, yielding a two-point correlation function with α = -0.28 ± 0.04, than the giant molecular cloud (GMCs) (α = -0.09 ± 0.03) within the same PAWS field. However, the clustering strength of the most massive GMCs, supposedly the progenitors of the young clusters for a star formation efficiency of a few per cent, is comparable (α = -0.35 ± 0.05) to that of the clusters. We find a galactocentric dependence for the coherence of star formation, in which clusters located in the inner region of the galaxy reside in smaller star-forming complexes and display more homogeneous distributions than clusters further from the centre. This result suggests a correlation between the survival of a cluster complex and its environment.},

We report on the discovery of a long (3 kpc), thin (aspect ratio 30/1), filament of CO gas that breaks up into roughly 10 individual knots. Each individual knot has a low internal velocity dispersion (≈10 km s-1) the dispersion of the ensemble of knots in the filament is also low (≈10 km s-1). At the other extreme, we find that the individual clouds in the supergiant molecular cloud 2 region discussed by Wilson and collaborators have a large range of internal velocity dispersions (10 to 80 km s-1), and a large dispersion among the ensemble (≈80 km s-1). Other large-scale features observed in CO emission, and their correspondence with historical counterparts using observations in other wavelengths, are also discussed. We compare the locations of small-scale CO features with a variety of multi-wavelength observations, in particular broad- (BVIJH) and narrow-band data (Hα and Paβ) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, and radio (3.6 cm) continuum observations taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. This comparison leads to the development of an evolutionary classification system that provides a framework for studying the sequence of star cluster formation and evolution—from diffuse supergiant molecular clouds (SGMCs) to proto, embedded, emerging, young, intermediate/old clusters. The relative timescales have been assessed by determining the fractional population of sources at each evolutionary stage. The main uncertainty in this estimate is the identification of four regions as candidate protoclusters (i.e., strong compact CO emission but no clearly associated radio emission). Using the evolutionary framework, we estimate that the maximum age range of clusters in a single GMC is ≈10 Myr, which suggests that the molecular gas is removed over this timescale, resulting in the cessation of star formation and the destruction of the GMC within a radius of about 200 pc.},

	abstract = {The earliest stages of star formation, when young stars are still deeply embedded in their natal clouds, represent a critical phase in the matter cycle between gas clouds and young stellar regions. Until now, the high-resolution infrared observations required for characterizing this heavily obscured phase (during which massive stars have formed, but optical emission is not detected) could only be obtained for a handful of the most nearby galaxies. One of the main hurdles has been the limited angular resolution of the Spitzer Space Telescope. With the revolutionary capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), it is now possible to investigate the matter cycle during the earliest phases of star formation as a function of the galactic environment. In this Letter, we demonstrate this by measuring the duration of the embedded phase of star formation and the implied time over which molecular clouds remain inert in the galaxy NGC 628 at a distance of 9.8 Mpc, demonstrating that the cosmic volume where this measurement can be made has increased by a factor of {\textgreater}100 compared to Spitzer. We show that young massive stars remain embedded for \$\{5.1\}\_\{-1.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.7\}\$ Myr ( \$\{2.3\}\_\{-1.4\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2.7\}\$ Myr of which being heavily obscured), representing {\textasciitilde}20\% of the total cloud lifetime. These values are in broad agreement with previous measurements in five nearby (D {\textless} 3.5 Mpc) galaxies and constitute a proof of concept for the systematic characterization of the early phase of star formation across the nearby galaxy population with the PHANGS-JWST survey.},

	abstract = {A primary new capability of JWST is the ability to penetrate the dust in star-forming galaxies to identify and study the properties of young star clusters that remain embedded in dust and gas. In this Letter we combine new infrared images taken with JWST with our optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of the starbursting barred (Seyfert2) spiral galaxy NGC 1365. We find that this galaxy has the richest population of massive young clusters of any known galaxy within 30 Mpc, with {\textasciitilde}30 star clusters that are more massive than 106 M ⊙ and younger than 10 Myr. Sixteen of these clusters are newly discovered from our JWST observations. An examination of the optical images reveals that 4 of 30 ({\textasciitilde}13\%) are so deeply embedded that they cannot be seen in the Hubble I band (A V ≳ 10 mag), and that 11 of 30 ({\textasciitilde}37\%) are missing in the HST B band, so age and mass estimates from optical measurements alone are challenging. These numbers suggest that massive clusters in NGC 1365 remain completely obscured in the visible for {\textasciitilde}1.3 ± 0.7 Myr and are either completely or partially obscured for {\textasciitilde}3.7 ± 1.1 Myr. We also use the JWST observations to gain new insights into the triggering of star cluster formation by the collision of gas and dust streamers with gas and dust in the bar. The JWST images reveal previously unknown structures (e.g., bridges and overshoot regions from stars that form in the bar) that help us better understand the orbital dynamics of barred galaxies and associated star-forming rings. Finally, we note that the excellent spatial resolution of the NIRCAM F200W filter provides a better way to separate barely resolved compact clusters from individual stars based on their sizes.},

	abstract = {We use new WFC3 observations of the nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M83 to develop two independent methods for estimating the ages of young star clusters. The first method uses the physical extent and morphology of Hα emission to estimate the ages of clusters younger than τ ≈ 10 Myr. It is based on the simple premise that the gas in very young (τ{\textless} a few Myr) clusters is largely coincident with the cluster stars, is in a small, ring-like structure surrounding the stars in slightly older clusters since massive star winds and supernovae have had time to push out the natal gas (e.g., τ ≈ 5 Myr), and is in a larger ring-like bubble for still older clusters (i.e., ≈5-10 Myr). If no Hα is associated with a cluster it is generally older than ≈10 Myr. The second method is based on an observed relation between pixel-to-pixel flux variations within clusters and their ages. This method relies on the fact that the brightest individual stars in a cluster are most prominent at ages around 10 Myr, and fall below the detection limit (i.e., M V {\textless} -3.5) for ages older than about 100 Myr. Older clusters therefore have a smoother appearance and smaller pixel-to-pixel variations. The youngest clusters also have lower flux variations, hence the relationship is double valued. This degeneracy in age can be broken using other age indicators such as Hα morphology. These two methods are the basis for a new morphological classification system which can be used to estimate the ages of star clusters based on their appearance. We compare previous age estimates of clusters in M83 determined from fitting UBVIHα measurements using predictions from stellar evolutionary models with our new morphological categories and find good agreement, at the ≈95\% level. The scatter within categories is ≈0.1 dex in log τ for young clusters ({\textless}10 Myr) and ≈0.5 dex for older ({\textgreater}10 Myr) clusters. A by-product of this study is the identification of 22 "single-star" H II regions in M83, with central stars having ages ≈4 Myr.},

	abstract = {Strong nebular emission lines are an important diagnostic tool for tracing the evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time. However, different observational setups can affect these lines, and the derivation of the physical nebular properties. We analyze 12 local star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopy SurveY (CLASSY) to assess the impact of using different aperture combinations on the determination of the physical conditions and gas-phase metallicity. We compare optical spectra observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release aperture, which has a 3″ diameter similar to COS, IFU, and long-slit spectra, including new LBT/MODS observations of five CLASSY galaxies. We calculate the reddening, electron densities and temperatures, metallicities, star formation rates, and equivalent widths (EWs). We find that measurements of the electron densities and temperatures, and metallicity remained roughly constant with aperture size, indicating that the gas conditions are relatively uniform for this sample. However, using IFU observations of three galaxies, we find that the E(B - V) values derived from the Balmer ratios decrease (by up to 53\%) with increasing aperture size. The values change most significantly in the center of the galaxies, and level out near the COS aperture diameter of 2.″5. We examine the relative contributions from the gas and stars using the Hα and [O III] λ5007 EWs as a function of aperture light fraction, but find little to no variations within a given galaxy. These results imply that the optical spectra provide nebular properties appropriate for the far-UV CLASSY spectra, even when narrow 1.″0 long-slit observations are used.},

The spectra have been extracted with an optimal algorithm and co-added to produce spectra with the best possible signal-to-noise ratio. Our data support the picture proposed earlier on the basis of UV spectra from the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory and from the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite that spiral galaxies of later Hubble class have higher flux at the shortest UV wavelengths than do spiral galaxies of earlier Hubble class. A comparison of the UV spectra of low- ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER) galaxies with the spectra of normal spiral galaxies shows that the UV continuum of LINERs is dominated by the galaxy continuum. In contrast, Seyfert 2 galaxies show a featureless blue continuum plus emission lines, with the UV spectrum of the host galaxy apparent only at the longest UV wavelengths. The starbursting, blue compact, and blue compact dwarf galaxies have UV continua that are flat or increasing toward short wavelengths, with a wide range in spectral index, going from Flambda\_ is proportional to λ{\textasciicircum}0.26+/-0.14{\textasciicircum} to Flambda is proportional to λ{\textasciicircum}-1.85+/- 0.06{\textasciicircum}. The spectral signature of dust with a wavelength dependence of the extinction such as is seen in the Milky Way is not apparent in these galaxies. The lack of an apparent dust feature (e.g., the 2200 A bump) implies either that the extinction law is different or that any dust present in the galaxies is in the form of clumps and does not contribute to the flux, owing to the very high optical depth.},

Nineteen spectra of star-forming regions and starburst galaxies were retrieved, reprocessed, and analyzed. The spectra cover the wavelength region 912-1800 Å, providing access to the domain of peak luminosity from a young stellar population. We created an atlas of galaxy spectra documenting the continuum and line properties with an emphasis on the relatively unexplored spectral region below 1200 Å. The dust obscuration law was derived from a comparison of the HUT spectra with synthetic population models. The law is similar to the commonly adopted starburst reddening curve at longer wavelengths and approaches the Milky Way law near the Lyman break. A simple power-law parameterization is given, which allows users to express the reddening law in terms of the stellar or nebular color excess at ultraviolet or optical wavelengths. The star formation histories were derived from the reddening-corrected continua and the ultraviolet line profiles. We find typical ages of tens of Myr and star formation densities ranging from less than 0.1 to more than 10 Msolar yr-1 kpc-2. The absorbed ultraviolet luminosity correlates very well with the far-infrared luminosity, as expected if the dominant dust absorption occurs in a foreground screen. This correlation holds even for the most luminous galaxies in our sample, whose IRAS luminosity is in excess of 1011 Lsolar. To the memory of Arthur F. Davidsen, a pioneer in ultraviolet observations and Principal Investigator of the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, who passed away on 2001 July 19.},

The composite reveals numerous weak nebular emission lines and stellar photospheric absorption lines that can serve as new physical diagnostics, particularly at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We report equivalent widths to aid in proposing for and interpreting JWST spectra. We examine the velocity profiles of strong absorption features in the composite, and in a matched composite of z∼ 0 COS/HST galaxy spectra. We find remarkable similarity in the velocity profiles at z∼ 0 and z∼ 2, suggesting that similar physical processes control the outflows across cosmic time. While the maximum outflow velocity depends strongly on ionization potential, the absorption-weighted mean velocity does not. As such, the bulk of the high-ionization absorption traces the low-ionization gas, with an additional blueshifted absorption tail extending to at least -2000 km s-1. We interpret this tail as arising from the stellar wind and photospheres of massive stars. Starburst99 models are able to replicate this high-velocity absorption tail. However, these theoretical models poorly reproduce several of the photospheric absorption features, indicating that improvements are needed to match observational constraints on the massive stellar content of star-forming galaxies at z∼ 2.

	abstract = {We present the first detailed analysis of the rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum of the gravitationally lensed Lyman break galaxy (LBG), the “8 o'clock arc”, obtained with the intermediate-resolution X-shooter spectrograph recently commissioned on the ESO Very Large Telescope. Besides MS 1512-cB58, the Cosmic Horseshoe, and the Cosmic Eye, three other lensed LBGs at comparable redshifts, this is the fourth of such a study, usually unfeasible at high redshifts. The spectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar features, and presents several similarities to the well-known MS 1512-cB58 LBG. The stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemic redshift, z\_sys = 2.7350 ±0.0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellar metallicity, Z=0.82{\textasciitilde}Z⊙, which is in excellent agreement with the metallicity determined from nebular emission lines. With a total stellar mass of ∼4.2 ×1011{\textasciitilde}M⊙, the 8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z{\textgreater}2 star-forming galaxies, although being located near the upper end of the distribution given its high mass and high metallicity. Broad He II λ1640 emission is found, indicative of the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars formed in an intense period of star formation. The 31 interstellar absorption lines detected led to the abundance measurements of 9 elements. The metallicity of the interstellar medium (ISM), Z=0.65{\textasciitilde}Z⊙ (Si), is very comparable to the metallicity of stars and ionized gas, and suggests that the ISM of the 8 o'clock arc has been rapidly polluted and enriched by ejecta of OB stars. The ISM lines extend over a very large velocity range, Δ υ ∼ 1000 km s-1, from about -800 to +300 km s-1 relative to the systemic redshift, and have their peak optical depth blueshifted relative to the stars, implying gas outflows of υ\_ISM ≃ -120 km s-1. The zero residual intensity in the strongest lines indicates a nearly complete coverage of the UV continuum by the ISM. The Lyα line is dominated by a damped absorption profile on top of which is superposed a weak emission, redshifted relative to the ISM lines by about +690 km s-1 and resulting from multiply backscattered Lyα photons emitted in the H II region surrounded by the cold, expanding ISM shell. A homogeneous spherical shell model with a constant outflow velocity, determined by the observations, is able to reproduce the observed Lyα line profile. Furthermore, the required dust content, E(B-V) ≈ 0.3, is in good agreement with the attenuation measured from the Balmer decrement. These results obtained from the radiation transfer modeling of the Lyα line in the 8 o'clock arc fully support the scenario proposed earlier, where the diversity of Lyα line profiles in Lyman break galaxies and Lyα emitters, from absorption to emission, is mostly due to variations of HI column density and dust content.

We present here a medium-resolution rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the source, which appears to be similar to the well-known Lyman-break galaxy MS1512-cB58 at z = 2.73. The spectral energy distribution is consistent with a stellar population of less than 30Ma, with an extinction of Av = 0.5 mag and an extinction-corrected star formation rate SFRUV of 200-300h-170Msolara-1. The Lyα line exhibits a damped profile in absorption produced by a column density of about NHI = (2.5 +/- 1.0) × 1021cm-2, superimposed on an emission line shifted both spatially (0.5 arcsec with respect to the UV continuum source) and in velocity space (+830kms-1 with respect to the low-ionization absorption lines from its interstellar medium), a clear signature of outflows with an expansion velocity of about 270kms-1. A strong emission line from HeII λ164.04 nm indicates the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars and reinforces the interpretation of a very young starburst.

Here, we aim to identify and study a sample of He IIλ1640-emitting galaxies at redshifts of z ∼ 2.5 - 5 in the deep VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Methods: We identified a total of 33 Bright He II emitters (S/N {\textgreater} 2.5) and 17 Faint emitters (S/N {\textless} 2.5) in the VANDELS survey and used the available deep multi-wavelength data to study their physical properties. After identifying seven potential AGNs in our sample and discarding them from further analysis, we divided the sample of Bright emitters into 20 Narrow (FWHM {\textless} 1000 km s-1) and 6 Broad (FWHM {\textgreater} 1000 km s-1) He II emitters. We created stacks of Faint, Narrow, and Broad emitters and measured other rest-frame UV lines such as O III] and C III] in both individual galaxies and stacks. We then compared the UV line ratios with the output of stellar population-synthesis models to study the ionising properties of He II emitters. Results: We do not see a significant difference between the stellar masses, star-formation rates, and rest-frame UV magnitudes of galaxies with He II and no He II emission. The stellar population models reproduce the observed UV line ratios from metals in a consistent manner, however they under-predict the total number of He II ionising photons, confirming earlier studies and suggesting that additional mechanisms capable of producing He II are needed, such as X-ray binaries or stripped stars. The models favour subsolar metallicities (∼0.1 Z⊙) and young stellar ages (106 - 107 years) for the He II emitters. However, the metallicity measured for He II emitters is comparable to that of non-He II emitters at similar redshifts. We argue that galaxies with He II emission may have undergone a recent star-formation event, or may be powered by additional sources of He II ionisation.},

We discuss their spectra, as well as reclassifying the previously known ones with our new data. Our survey also revealed four newly found Of-type stars, including one of the O5f?p type, which is one of the earliest type stars known in the SMC. Another newly identified Of star is AV 398 (O8.5 If), a star often used in extinction studies under the assumption that it is of early B type. We recover S18 (AV 154), a B[e] star whose spectrum currently lacks He II λ4686 emission but which must have had strong emission a year earlier; we compare this star to S Dor, suggesting that it is indeed a luminous blue variable. We also find a previously unknown symbiotic star whose spectrum is nearly identical to the Galactic symbiotic AG Dra. More important, perhaps, than any of these discoveries is the demonstration that there is not a significant number of W-R stars waiting to be discovered in the SMC. The number of W-R stars is a factor of 3 times lower in the SMC (per unit luminosity) than in the LMC. This strongly suggests that at the low metallicity that characterizes the SMC only the most massive stars can evolve to W-R type.},

In our simulations, the initial rotating velocities are taken as 0, 250, 500, and 650 km s-1, and the metallicities equal to 0.02, 0.014, 0.008, 0.006, 0.004, and 0.002. We show our rapid rotation models in the HR diagram compared with the observations. We find that the rotational mixing is less efficient at high metallicity, and these stars become Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars when the helium in their center is ignited. However, rapid rotating massive stars at low metallicity can easily evolve into WR stars due to the rotation resulted in chemically homogeneous evolution. This can explain the origin of single WR stars in galaxy at low metallicity. In our models, the observed SMC WR stars are consistent with the single-star evolution models. However, at higher metallicities our single-star evolution models can only explain the luminous, hydrogen-rich WN stars and O stars (which are classified as WR stars previously).},

	abstract = {Increasingly large samples of galaxies are now being discovered at redshifts z {\textasciitilde} 5-6 and higher. Many of these objects are inferred to be young, low in mass, and relatively unreddened, but detailed analysis of their high quality spectra will not be possible until the advent of future facilities. In this paper, we shed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low-mass galaxy by presenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of Q2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z = 2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and unusual properties: BX418 is young ({\textless}100 Myr), low mass (M sstarf {\textasciitilde} 109 M sun), low in metallicity (Z {\textasciitilde} 1/6 Z sun), and unreddened (E(B - V) {\textasciitilde}= 0.02, UV continuum slope β = -2.1). We infer a metallicity 12 + log(O/H) = 7.9 ± 0.2 from the rest-frame optical emission lines. We also determine the metallicity via the direct, electron temperature method, using the ratio O III] λλ1661, 1666/[O III] λ5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12 + log(O/H) = 7.8 ± 0.1. These measurements place BX418 among the most metal-poor galaxies observed in emission at high redshift. The rest-frame UV spectrum, which represents {\textasciitilde}12 hr of integration with the Keck telescope, contains strong emission from Lyα (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 Å), He II λ1640 (both stellar and nebular), C III] λλ1907, 1909 and O III] λλ1661, 1666. The C IV/C III] ratio indicates that the source of ionization is unlikely to be an active galactic nucleus. Analysis of the He II, O III], and C III] line strengths indicates a very high ionization parameter log U {\textasciitilde} -1, while Lyα and the interstellar absorption lines indicate that outflowing gas is highly ionized over a wide range of velocities. It remains to be determined how many of BX418's unique spectral features are due to its global properties, such as low metallicity and dust extinction, and how many are indicative of a short-lived phase in the early evolution of an otherwise normal star-forming galaxy.

	abstract = {We use a sample of 87 rest-frame UV-selected star-forming galaxies with mean spectroscopic redshift =2.26+/-0.17 to study the correlation between metallicity and stellar mass at high redshift. Using stellar masses determined from SED fitting to observed 0.3-8 μm photometry, we divide the sample into six bins in stellar mass and construct six composite Hα+[N II] spectra from all of the objects in each bin. We estimate the mean oxygen abundance in each bin from the [N II]/Hα ratio and find a monotonic increase in metallicity with increasing stellar mass, from 12+log(O/H){\textless}8.2 for galaxies with *{\textgreater}=2.7×109 Msolar to 12+log(O/H)=8.6 for galaxies with *{\textgreater}=1.0×1011 Msolar. We use the empirical relation between SFR density and gas density to estimate the gas fractions of the galaxies, finding an increase in gas fraction with decreasing stellar mass. These gas fractions, combined with the observed metallicities, allow the estimation of the effective yield yeff as a function of stellar mass; in constrast to observations in the local universe, which show a decrease in yeff with decreasing baryonic mass, we find a slight increase. Such a variation of metallicity with gas fraction is best fitted by a model with supersolar yield and an outflow rate {\textasciitilde}4 times higher than the SFR. We conclude that the mass-metallicity relation at high redshift is driven by the increase in metallicity as the gas fraction decreases through star formation and is likely modulated by metal loss from strong outflows in galaxies of all masses.

	abstract = {We present initial results of an ESO-VLT large programme (AMAZE) aimed at determining the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation at z {\textgreater} 3 by means of deep near-IR spectroscopy. Gas metallicities are measured, for an initial sample of nine star forming galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 3.5, by means of optical nebular lines redshifted into the near-IR. Stellar masses are accurately determined by using Spitzer-IRAC data, which sample the rest-frame near-IR stellar light in these distant galaxies. When compared with previous surveys, the mass-metallicity relation inferred at z {\textasciitilde} 3.5 shows an evolution much stronger than observed at lower redshifts. The evolution is prominent even in massive galaxies, indicating that z {\textasciitilde} 3 is an epoch of major action in terms of star formation and metal enrichment also for massive systems. There are also indications that the metallicity evolution of low mass galaxies is stronger relative to high mass systems, an effect which can be considered the chemical version of the galaxy downsizing. The mass-metallicity relation observed at z {\textasciitilde} 3.5 is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of some hierarchical evolutionary models. Such discrepancies suggest that at z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies are assembled mostly with relatively un-evolved sub-units, i.e. small galaxies with low star formation efficiency. The bulk of the star formation and metallicity evolution probably occurs once small galaxies are already assembled into bigger systems.

	abstract = {We present the first results of a project, Lyman-break galaxies Stellar populations and Dynamics (LSD), aimed at obtaining spatially resolved, near-infrared (IR) spectroscopy of a complete sample of Lyman-break galaxies at z {\textasciitilde} 3. Deep observations with adaptive optics resulted in the detection of the main optical lines, such as [OII] λ3727, Hβ and [OIII] λ5007, which are used to study sizes, star formation rates (SFRs), morphologies, gas-phase metallicities, gas fractions and effective yields. Optical, near-IR and Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera photometry are used to measure stellar mass. We obtain that morphologies are usually complex, with the presence of several peaks of emissions and companions that are not detected in broad-band images. Typical metallicities are 10-50 per cent solar, with a strong evolution of the mass-metallicity relation from lower redshifts. Stellar masses, gas fraction and evolutionary stages vary significantly among the galaxies, with less massive galaxies showing larger fractions of gas. In contrast with observations in the local universe, effective yields decrease with stellar mass and reach solar values at the low-mass end of the sample. This effect can be reproduced by gas infall with rates of the order of the SFRs. Outflows are present but are not needed to explain the mass-metallicity relation. We conclude that a large fraction of these galaxies is actively creating stars after major episodes of gas infall or merging.

	abstract = {The most massive stars provide an essential source of recycled material for young clusters and galaxies. While very massive stars (VMS, M{\textgreater}100 \${\textbackslash}rm \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) are relatively rare compared to O stars, they lose disproportionately large amounts of mass already from the onset of core H-burning. VMS have optically thick winds with elevated mass-loss rates in comparison to optically thin standard O-star winds. We compute wind yields and ejected masses on the main sequence, and we compare enhanced mass-loss rates to standard ones. We calculate solar metallicity wind yields from MESA stellar evolution models in the range 50 - 500 \${\textbackslash}rm \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, including a large nuclear network of 92 isotopes, investigating not only the CNO-cycle, but also the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles. VMS with enhanced winds eject 5-10 times more H-processed elements (N, Ne, Na, Al) on the main sequence in comparison to standard winds, with possible consequences for observed anti-correlations, such as C-N and Na-O, in globular clusters. We find that for VMS 95\% of the total wind yields is produced on the main sequence, while only {\textasciitilde} 5\% is supplied by the post-main sequence. This implies that VMS with enhanced winds are the primary source of 26Al, contrasting previous works where classical Wolf-Rayet winds had been suggested to be responsible for Galactic 26Al enrichment. Finally, 200 \${\textbackslash}rm \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ stars eject 100 times more of each heavy element in their winds than 50 \${\textbackslash}rm \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ stars, and even when weighted by an IMF their wind contribution is still an order of magnitude higher than that of 50 \${\textbackslash}rm \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ stars.},

The observed distributions of nitrogen- (WN) and carbon (WC)-sequence WR stars in the Milky Way and in nearby star-forming galaxies are discussed; these imply lower limits to progenitor masses of ?25, 40, and 75 M⊙ for hydrogen-depleted (He-burning) WN, WC, and H-rich (H-burning) WN stars, respectively. WR stars in massive star binaries permit studies of wind-wind interactions and dust formation in WC systems.

This discrepancy can be lessened by taking account of the following: (1) the number and distribution of very luminous early-B supergiants suggests that they are also core hydrogen burning objects, so that these predecessors to W-R stars must be counted among the O star statistics; (2) overshooting during the W-R core helium burning phase might be important, thus lengthening the lifetime of this phase; (3) star formation in the Galaxy, at least for the most massive stars, might occur in relatively short-lived bursts.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the observational dependence of the mass-loss rate in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars on the metal content of their atmospheres. The metal content of stars in the Magellanic Clouds is discussed, and a critical assessment is given of state-of-the-art mass-loss determinations of OB stars in these two satellite systems and the Milky-Way. Assuming a power-law dependence of mass loss on metal content, dot\{M\} ∝ Zm, and adopting a theoretical relation between the terminal flow velocity and metal content, v\_∞ ∝ Z0.13 (Leitherer et al. 1992, ApJ, 401, 596), we find m = 0.83 ± 0.16 for non-clumped outflows from an analysis of the wind momentum luminosity relation (WLR) for stars more luminous than 105.2 \{L⊙\}. Within the errors, this result is in agreement with the prediction m = 0.69 ± 0.10 by Vink et al. (2001, A\&A, 369, 574). Absolute empirical values for the mass loss, based on Hα and ultraviolet (UV) wind lines, are found to be a factor of two higher than predictions in this high luminosity regime. If this difference is attributed to inhomogeneities in the wind, and this clumping does not impact the predictions, this would imply that luminous O and early-B stars have clumping factors in their Hα and UV line forming regions of about a factor of four. For lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengths can generally no longer be derived from optical spectral lines (essentially Hα) and one must currently rely on the analysis of UV lines. We confirm that in this low-luminosity domain the observed Galactic WLR is found to be much steeper than expected from theory (although the specific sample is rather small), leading to a discrepancy between UV mass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of L 104.75 \{L⊙\}, the origin of which is unknown. We emphasize that even if the current mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars would turn out to be overestimated as a result of wind clumping, but the degree of clumping would be rather independent of metallicity, the scalings derived in this study are expected to remain correct.

	abstract = {Context: The availability of large spectroscopic datasets has opened up the possibility of constructing large samples of rare objects in a systematic manner. Aims: The goal of this study is to analyse the properties of galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features in their optical spectrum using spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Release 6. With this unprecedentedly large sample we aim to constrain the properties of the Wolf-Rayet phase and its impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. Methods: We carried out very careful continuum subtraction on all galaxies with equivalent widths of Hβ{\textgreater}2 Å in emission and identify Wolf-Rayet features using a mixture of automatic and visual classification. We combined this with spectroscopic and photometric information from the SDSS and derive metal abundances using a number of methods. Results: We find a total of 570 galaxies with significant Wolf-Rayet (WR) features and a further 1115 potential candidates, several times more than even the largest heterogeneously assembled catalogues. We discuss in detail the properties of galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features with a focus on their empirical properties. We are able to accurately quantify the incidence of Wolf-Rayet galaxies with metal abundance and show that the likelihood of otherwise similar galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features increases with increasing metallicity, but that WR features are found in galaxies of a wide range in morphology. The large sample allows us to show explicitly that there are systematic differences in the metal abundances of WR and non-WR galaxies. The most striking result is that, below EW(Hβ) = 100 Å, Wolf-Rayet galaxies show an elevated N/O relative to non-WR galaxies. We interpret this as a rapid enrichment of the ISM from WR winds. We also show that the model predictions for WR features strongly disagree with the observations at low metallicity; while they do agree quite well with the data at solar abundances. We discuss possible reasons for this and show that models incorporating binary evolution reproduce the low-metallicity results reasonably well. Finally we combine the WR sample with a sample of galaxies with nebular He ii λ 4686 to show that, at 12 + log O/H{\textless} 8, the main sources of He ii ionising photons appears to be O stars, arguing for a less dense stellar wind at these metallicities, while at higher abundances WN stars might increasingly dominate the ionisation budget.

SMC WN3-4 stars possess line luminosities which are a factor of 4 times lower than LMC counterparts, incorporating several binary SMC WN3-4 stars from the literature. Similar results are found for WN5-6 stars, despite reduced statistics, incorporating observations of single LMC WN5-9 stars from the literature. C iv λ5808 line luminosities of carbon sequence WR stars in the SMC and IC 1613 (both WO subtypes) from the recent literature are a factor of 3 lower than LMC WC stars from Mt Stromlo/DBS spectrophotometry, although similar results are also obtained for the sole LMC WO star. We demonstrate how reduced line luminosities at low metallicity follow naturally if WR winds are metallicity-dependent, as recent empirical and theoretical results suggest. We apply mass loss-metallicity scalings to atmospheric non-LTE models of Milky Way and LMC WR stars to predict the wind signatures of WR stars in the metal-poor star forming WR galaxy I Zw 18. WN He ii λ4686 line luminosities are 7-20 times lower than in metal-rich counterparts of identical bolometric luminosity, whilst WC C iv λ5808 line luminosities are 3-6 times lower. Significant He+ Lyman continuum fluxes are predicted for metal-poor early-type WR stars. Consequently, our results suggest a larger population of WR stars in I Zw 18 than is presently assumed, particularly for WN stars, potentially posing a severe challenge to evolutionary models at very low metallicity. Finally, reduced wind strengths from WR stars at low metallicities impacts upon the immediate circumstellar environment of long duration GRB afterglows, particularly since the host galaxies of high-redshift GRBs tend to be metal-poor.},

	abstract = {Using the latest stellar evolution models, theoretical stellar spectra, and a compilation of observed emission line strengths from Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars, we construct evolutionary synthesis models for young starbursts. We explicitly distinguish between the various W-R subtypes (WN, WC, WO), whose relative frequency is a strong function of metallicity, and we treat O and Of stars separately. We calculate the numbers of O and W-R stars produced during a starburst and provide detailed predictions of UV and optical emission line strengths for both the W-R stellar lines and the major nebular hydrogen and helium emission lines, as a function of several input parameters related to the starburst episode. We also derive the theoretical frequency of W-R-rich starbursts. Our models predict that nebular He II λ4686 emission from a low-metallicity starburst should be associated with the presence of WC/WO stars and/or hot WN stars evolving to become WC/WO stars. In addition, W-R stars contribute to broad components beneath the nebular Balmer lines; the broad W-R component may constitute several percent of the total flux in the line. We review the various techniques used to derive the W-R and O star content from integrated spectra, assess their accuracy, and propose two new formulae to estimate the W-R/O number ratio from UV or optical spectra. We also explore the implications of the formation of W-R stars through mass transfer in close binary systems in instantaneous bursts. While the formation of W-R stars through Roche lobe overflow prolongs the W-R-dominated phase, there are clear observational signatures that allow us to distinguish the phases in which W-R stars are formed predominantly through single or binary star channels. In particular at low metallicities, when massive close binaries contribute significantly to the formation of W-R stars, the binary-dominated phase is expected to occur at ages corresponding to relatively low Hβ equivalent widths. The observational features predicted by our models allow a detailed quantitative determination of the massive star population in a starburst region (particularly in so-called ``W-R galaxies'') from its integrated spectrum and provide a means of deriving the burst properties (e.g., duration and age) and the parameters of the initial mass function of young starbursts. The model predictions should provide the most reliable determinations to date. They can also be used to test current theories of massive star evolution and atmospheres and to investigate the variation in stellar properties with metallicity.},

We also present an analysis of the physical properties of 189 star forming galaxies with strong He II 4686 emissions. These star-forming galaxies provide constraints on the hard ionizing continuum of massive stars. To make a quantitative comparison with observation we use photoionization models and examine how different stellar population models affect the predicted He II 4686 emission. We confirm previous findings that the models can predict He II 4686 emission only for instantaneous bursts of 20\% solar metallicity or higher, and only for ages of {\textasciitilde} 4 - 5 Myr, the period when the extreme-ultraviolet continuum is dominated by emission from Wolf-Rayet stars. We find however that 83 of the star-forming galaxies (40\%) in our sample do not have Wolf-Rayet features in their spectra despite showing strong nebular He II 4686 emission.

This questions recent claims about flat initial mass function (IMF) slopes ( alpha {\textasciitilde} 1--2) in these objects. If the evolution of the burst is properly treated, we find that the observations are indeed compatible with a Salpeter IMF, in agreement with earlier studies. Including recent predictions from non-LTE, line-blanketed model atmospheres that account for stellar winds, we synthesize the nebular and WR He II lambda 4686 emission in young starbursts. For metallicities 1/5Zsolar {\textless}= Z {\textless}= Zsolar, we predict a strong nebular He II emission due to a significant fraction of WC stars in early WR phases of the burst. For other metallicities, broad WR emission will always dominate the He II emission. Our predictions of the nebular He II intensity agree well with the observations in WR galaxies, and an important fraction of the giant H II regions where nebular He II is detected. We propose further observational tests of our result.},

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

	abstract = {We refine a technique to measure the absorption-corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest-frame UV quantities alone and apply it to Lyman-limit U dropouts at z{\textasciitilde}3 found in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). The method is based on an observed correlation between the ratio of far-infrared (FIR) to UV fluxes with spectral slope β (a UV color). A simple fit to this relation allows the UV flux absorbed by dust and reprocessed to the FIR to be calculated, and hence the dust-free UV luminosity to be determined. International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra and Infrared Astronomical Satellite fluxes of local starbursts are used to calibrate the FFIR/F1600 versus β relation in terms of A1600 (the dust absorption at 1600 Å) and the transformation from broadband photometric color to β. Both calibrations are almost completely independent of theoretical stellar-population models. We show that the recent marginal and nondetections of HDF U dropouts at radio and submillimeter wavelengths are consistent with their assumed starburst nature and our calculated A1600. This is also true of recent observations of the ratio of optical emission-line flux to UV flux density in the brightest U dropouts. This latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dust extinction. In U dropouts, absolute magnitude M1600,0 correlates with β: brighter galaxies are redder, as is observed to be the case for local starburst galaxies. This suggests that a mass-metallicity relationship is already in place at z{\textasciitilde}3. The absorption-corrected UV luminosity function of U dropouts extends up to M1600,0{\textasciitilde}-24 AB mag, corresponding to a star formation rate {\textasciitilde}200 {\textbackslash}Mscrsolar yr-1 (H0=50 km s-1 Mpc-3 and q0=0.5 are assumed throughout). The absorption-corrected UV luminosity density at z{\textasciitilde}3 is ρ1600,0{\textgreater}=1.4×1027 ergs-1 Hz-1 Mpc-1. It is still a lower limit since completeness corrections have not been done and because only galaxies with A1600{\textless}{\textasciitilde}3.6 mag are blue enough in the UV to be selected as U dropouts. The luminosity-weighted mean dust-absorption factor of our sample is 5.4+/-0.9 at 1600 Å.

	abstract = {Using a complete sample of {\textasciitilde}300 star-forming galaxies within 11 Mpc of the Milky Way, we evaluate the consistency between star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from the far ultraviolet (FUV) non-ionizing continuum and Hα nebular emission, assuming standard conversion recipes in which the SFR scales linearly with luminosity at a given wavelength. Our analysis probes SFRs over 5 orders of magnitude, down to ultra-low activities on the order of {\textasciitilde}10-4 M sun yr-1. The data are drawn from the 11 Mpc Hα and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey (11HUGS), which has obtained Hα fluxes from ground-based narrowband imaging, and UV fluxes from imaging with GALEX. For normal spiral galaxies (SFR {\textasciitilde} 1 M sun yr-1), our results are consistent with previous work which has shown that FUV SFRs tend to be lower than Hα SFRs before accounting for internal dust attenuation, but that there is relative consistency between the two tracers after proper corrections are applied. However, a puzzle is encountered at the faint end of the luminosity function. As lower luminosity dwarf galaxies, roughly less active than the Small Magellanic Cloud, are examined, Hα tends to increasingly underpredict the total SFR relative to the FUV. The trend is evident prior to corrections for dust attenuation, which affects the FUV more than the nebular Hα emission, so this general conclusion is robust to the effects of dust. Although past studies have suggested similar trends, this is the first time this effect is probed with a statistical sample for galaxies with SFR {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.1 M sun yr-1. By SFR {\textasciitilde} 0.003 M sun yr-1, the average Hα-to-FUV flux ratio is lower than expected by a factor of two, and at the lowest SFRs probed, the ratio exhibits an order of magnitude discrepancy for the handful of galaxies that remain in the sample. A range of standard explanations does not appear to be able to fully account for the magnitude of the systematic. Some recent work has argued for a stellar initial mass function which is deficient in high-mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and we also consider this scenario. Under the assumption that the FUV traces the SFR in dwarf galaxies more robustly, the prescription relating Hα luminosity to SFR is re-calibrated for use in the low SFR regime when FUV data are not available.},

Measures of opacity in local galaxies are reviewed together with widely used theoretical and empirical methods for quantifying its effects. Existing evidence shows that the dust content of nearby galaxies depends not only on their morphology but also on their luminosity and activity level. A digression is devoted to starbursts in view of their potential relevance for measures of opacity in distant galaxies. Scarcity of coherent multiwavelength data sets hampers our ability to derive reliable obscuration estimates in intermediate- and high-redshift galaxies. This, in turn, limits the reliability of inferred physical quantities, such as star formation rates, stellar population ages, galaxy luminosity functions, and others.},

We classify 3757 star clusters in 16 nearby galaxies according to their H α morphology (concentrated, partially exposed, no emission), using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey (LEGUS). We find: (1) The mean SED ages of clusters with concentrated (1-2 Myr) and partially exposed H II region morphologies (2-3 Myr) indicate a relatively early onset of gas clearing and a short (1-2 Myr) clearing time-scale. (2) The reddening of clusters can be overestimated due to the presence of red supergiants, which is a result of stochastic sampling of the IMF in low mass clusters. (3) The age-reddening degeneracy impacts the results of the SED fitting - out of 1408 clusters with M* ≥ 5000 M⊙, we find that at least 46 (3 per cent) have SED ages which appear significantly underestimated or overestimated based on H α and their environment, while the total percentage of poor age estimates is expected to be several times larger. (4) Lastly, we examine the dependence of the morphological classifications on spatial resolution. At HST resolution, our conclusions are robust to the distance range spanned by the sample (3-10 Mpc). However, analysis of ground-based H α images shows that compact and partially exposed morphologies frequently cannot be distinguished from each other.},

Here we present new HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of seven nearby ({\textless}120 Mpc) star-forming regions hosting very young stellar populations ({\textasciitilde}4-20 Myr) with optical Wolf-Rayet stellar wind signatures, ideal laboratories in which to benchmark these stellar models. We detect nebular C III] in all seven, but at equivalent widths uniformly {\textless}10 Å. This suggests that even for very young stellar populations, the highest equivalent width C III] emission at ≥15 Å is reserved for inefficiently cooled gas at metallicities at or below that of the SMC. The spectra also reveal strong C IV P-Cygni profiles and broad He II emission formed in the winds of massive stars, including some of the most prominent He II stellar wind lines ever detected in integrated spectra. We find that the latest stellar population synthesis prescriptions with improved treatment of massive stars nearly reproduce the entire range of stellar He II wind strengths observed here. However, we find that these models cannot simultaneously match the strongest wind features alongside the optical nebular line constraints. This discrepancy can be naturally explained by an overabundance of very massive stars produced by a high incidence of binary mass transfer and mergers occurring on short ≲10 Myr time-scales, suggesting these processes may be crucial for understanding systems dominated by young stars both nearby and in the early Universe.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

We study ∼700 young clusters (≤10 Myr) in three nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 7793, NGC 4395, and NGC 1313) using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic Ultraviolet Survey). Clusters are classified by their H α morphology (concentrated, partially exposed, no-emission) and whether they have neighbouring clusters (which could affect the clearing time-scales). Through visual inspection of the HST images, and analysis of ages, reddenings, and stellar masses from spectral energy distributions fitting, together with the (U- B), (V - I) colours, we find (1) the median ages indicate a progression from concentrated (∼3 Myr), to partially exposed (∼4 Myr), to no H α emission ({\textgreater}5 Myr), consistent with the expected temporal evolution of H II regions and previous results. However, (2) similarities in the age distributions for clusters with concentrated and partially exposed H α morphologies imply a short time-scale for gas clearing (≲1 Myr). Also, (3) our cluster sample's median mass is ∼1000 M⊙, and a significant fraction (∼ 20\{\{ per cent\}\}) contain one or more bright red sources (presumably supergiants), which can mimic reddening effects. Finally, (4) the median E(B - V) values for clusters with concentrated H α and those without H α emission appear to be more similar than expected (∼0.18 versus ∼0.14, respectively), but when accounting for stochastic effects, clusters without H α emission are less reddened. To mitigate stochastic effects, we experiment with synthesizing more massive clusters by stacking fluxes of clusters within each H α morphological class. Composite isolated clusters also reveal a colour and age progression for H α morphological classes, consistent with analysis of the individual clusters.},

We directly compare the kinetic energy of expanding superbubbles and the turbulent motions in the interstellar medium with the mechanical energy deposited by massive stars in the form of winds and supernovae, with the aim to answer whether the stellar feedback is responsible for the observed turbulent motions and to quantify the fraction of mechanical energy retained in the superbubbles. Based on the distribution of the flux and velocity dispersion in the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line, we select 1484 regions of locally elevated velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\$(H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$){\textgreater}45 km/s), including at least 171 expanding superbubbles. We analyse these regions and relate their properties to those of the young stellar associations and star clusters identified in PHANGS-HST data. We find a good correlation between the kinetic energy of the ionised gas and the total mechanical energy input from supernovae and stellar winds from the stellar associations, with a typical coupling efficiency of 10-20\%. The contribution of mechanical energy by the supernovae alone is not sufficient to explain the measured kinetic energy of the ionised gas, which implies that pre-supernova feedback in the form of radiation/thermal pressure and winds is necessary. We find that the gas kinetic energy decreases with metallicity for our sample covering Z=0.5-1.0 Zsun, reflecting the lower impact of stellar feedback. For the sample of superbubbles, we find that about 40\% of the young stellar associations are preferentially located in their rims. We also find a slightly higher (by {\textasciitilde}15\%) fraction of the youngest ({\textless}3 Myr) stellar associations in the rims of the superbubbles than in the centres, and the opposite for older associations, which implies possible propagation or triggering of star formation.},

A currently unanswered question in this field is how long these massive clusters remain embedded in their natal gas, with important implications for the formation of multiple populations that have been used to explain phenomena observed in globular clusters. We present an analysis of ages and masses of the young massive cluster population of M83. Through visual inspection of the clusters, and comparison of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and position in colour-colour space, the clusters are all exposed (no longer embedded) by {\textless}4 Myr, most likely less, indicating that current proposed age spreads within older clusters are unlikely. We also present several methods of constraining the ages of very young massive clusters. This can often be difficult using SED fitting due to a lack of information to disentangle age-extinction degeneracies and possible inaccurate assumptions in the models used for the fitting. The individual morphology of the Hα around each cluster has a significant effect on the measured fluxes, which contributes to inaccuracies in the age estimates for clusters younger than 10 Myr using SED fitting. This is due to model uncertainties and aperture effects. Our methods to help constrain ages of young clusters include using the near-infrared and spectral features, such as Wolf-Rayet stars.},

Despite previous work suggesting that massive star clusters clear out their natal material before the massive stars evolve into the WR phase, WR stars have been detected in several emerging massive star clusters. These detections suggest that the timescale for clusters to emerge can be at least as long as the time required to produce WR stars (a few million years), and could also indicate that WR stars may be providing the tipping point in the combined feedback processes that drive a massive star cluster to emerge. We explore the potential overlap between the emerging phase and the WR phase with an observational survey to search for WR stars in emerging massive star clusters hosting WR stars. We select candidate emerging massive star clusters from known radio continuum sources with thermal emission and obtain optical spectra with the 4 m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory and the 6.5 m MMT.4 We identify 21 sources with significantly detected WR signatures, which we term “emerging WR clusters.” WR features are detected in ∼50\% of the radio-selected sample, and thus we find that WR stars are commonly present in currently emerging massive star clusters. The observed extinctions and ages suggest that clusters without WR detections remain embedded for longer periods of time, and may indicate that WR stars can aid, and therefore accelerate, the emergence process.},

Here, we fit the spectra of ten stars with new atmosphere models in order to constrain their stellar properties precisely. We find that the stellar properties align well with the theoretical expectations from binary evolution models for helium-core burning envelope-stripped stars. The fits confirm that the stars have high effective temperatures (Teff{\textasciitilde}50-100kK), high surface gravities (log g {\textasciitilde}5), and hydrogen-poor/helium-rich surfaces (X(H, surf){\textasciitilde}0-0.4) while showing for the first time a range of bolometric luminosities (10{\textasciicircum}3-10{\textasciicircum}5 Lsun), small radii ({\textasciitilde}0.5-1Rsun), and low Eddington factors (Gamma\_e{\textasciitilde}0.006-0.4). Using these properties, we derive intermediate current masses ({\textasciitilde}1-8Msun), which suggest that their progenitors were massive stars ({\textasciitilde}5-25Msun) and that a subset will reach core-collapse, leaving behind neutron stars or black holes. Using the model fits, we also estimate the emission rates of ionizing photons for these stars, which agree well with previous model expectations. Further, by computing models for a range of mass-loss rates, we find that the stellar winds are weaker than predicted by any existing scheme (Mdot(wind){\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1e-9 Msun/yr). The properties of this first sample of intermediate mass helium stars suggest they both contain progenitors of type Ib and IIb supernovae, and provide important benchmarks for binary evolution and population synthesis models.},

The synthetic stellar populations include both single stars and interacting binary stars. We compare these models to the observed emission lines of 254 H II regions of 13 nearby spiral galaxies and 21 dwarf galaxies drawn from archival data. The models are created using the combination of the BPASS (Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis) code with the photoionization code CLOUDY to study the differences caused by the inclusion of interacting binary stars in the stellar population. We obtain agreement with the observed emission line ratios from the nearby star-forming regions and discuss the effect of binary-star evolution pathways on the nebular ionization of H II regions. We find that at population ages above 10 Myr, single-star models rapidly decrease in flux and ionization strength, while binary-star models still produce strong flux and high [O III]/H β ratios. Our models can reproduce the metallicity of H II regions from spiral galaxies, but we find higher metallicities than previously estimated for the H II regions from dwarf galaxies. Comparing the equivalent width of H β emission between models and observations, we find that accounting for ionizing photon leakage can affect age estimates for H II regions. When it is included, the typical age derived for H II regions is 5 Myr from single-star models, and up to 10 Myr with binary-star models. This is due to the existence of binary-star evolution pathways, which produce more hot Wolf-Rayet and helium stars at older ages. For future reference, we calculate new BPASS binary maximal starburst lines as a function of metallicity, and for the total model population, and present these in Appendix A.},

We discuss models with zero rotation velocity and with velocities of 40\% of the break-up velocity on the zero-age main-sequence. These values are expected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellar populations. The new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous and hotter due to a larger convective core and enhanced surface abundances. This results in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral energy distribution of a population containing massive stars. The changes are most significant at the shortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to a factor of five is predicted. We also show that high equivalent widths of recombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very young age but can be achieved at ages as late as {\textasciitilde}107 yr. Comparison of these two boundary cases (0\% and 40\% of the break-up velocity) will allow users to evaluate the effects of rotation and provide guidance for calibrating the stellar evolution models. We also introduce a new theoretical ultraviolet spectral library built from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet atmospheres. Its purpose is to help identify signatures of Wolf-Rayet stars in the ultraviolet whose strength is sensitive to the particulars of the evolution models. The new models are available for solar and one-seventh solar metallicities. A complete suite of models can be generated on the Starburst99 Web site. The updated Starburst99 package can be retrieved from that Web site as well.},

	abstract = {We present a dust spectral energy distribution (SED) and binary stellar population analysis revisiting the dust production rates (DPRs) in the winds of carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) binaries and their impact on galactic dust budgets. DustEM SED models of 19 Galactic WC "dustars" reveal DPRs of \$\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{d\}{\textbackslash}sim \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}{\textbackslash}mbox\{--\}\{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}\$ M⊙ yr-1 and carbon dust condensation fractions, χC, between 0.002\% and 40\%. A large (0.1-1.0 μm) dust grain size composition is favored for efficient dustars where χC ≳ 1\%. Results for dustars with known orbital periods verify a power-law relation between χC, orbital period, WC mass-loss rate, and wind velocity consistent with predictions from theoretical models of dust formation in colliding-wind binaries. We incorporated dust production into Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) models to analyze dust production rates from WC dustars, asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and core-collapse supernovae (SNe). BPASS models assuming constant star formation (SF) and a coeval 106 M⊙ stellar population were performed at low, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)-like, and solar metallicities (Z = 0.001, 0.008, and 0.020). Both constant SF and coeval models indicate that SNe are net dust destroyers at all metallicities. Constant SF models at LMC-like metallicities show that AGB stars slightly outproduce WC binaries and RSGs by factors of 2-3, whereas at solar metallicities WC binaries are the dominant source of dust for ∼60 Myr until the onset of AGBs, which match the dust input of WC binaries. Coeval population models show that, for "bursty" SF, AGB stars dominate dust production at late times (t ≳ 70 Myr).},

	abstract = {Massive colliding-wind binaries that host a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star present a potentially important source of dust and chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium. However, the chemical composition and survival of dust formed from such systems is not well understood. The carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binary WR 140 presents an ideal astrophysical laboratory for investigating these questions, given its well-defined orbital period and predictable dust-formation episodes every 7.93 years around periastron passage. We present observations from our Early Release Science programme (ERS 1349) with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer and Imager that reveal the spectral and spatial signatures of nested circumstellar dust shells around WR 140. MIRI medium-resolution spectroscopy of the second dust shell and Imager detections of over 17 shells formed throughout approximately the past 130 years confirm the survival of carbonaceous dust grains from WR 140 that are probably carriers of `unidentified infrared'-band features at 6.4 and 7.7 μm. The observations indicate that dust-forming carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet binaries can enrich the interstellar medium with organic compounds and carbonaceous dust.},
